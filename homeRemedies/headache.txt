1.Crush it with cayenne
Utilizing something spicy may not sound headache helpful, but cayenne is somewhat revered in the kingdom of natural remedies to treat pain and inflammation. 
The secret behind its success lies in an ingredient called capsaicin, which inhibits something in our body that is one of the main elements in pain perception called Substance P. 
In short, Substance P is part of what makes us feel pain, and the capsaicin depletes it. 
Numerous studies, the first in 1998 in The Clinical Journal of Pain, support that when applied topically to the nasal passages; people experience a significant decrease in the severity of their headaches, all thanks to capsaicin.

You will need…
-1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder
-4 ounces of warm water
-cotton swabs

Directions

Dilute a ½ teaspoon of cayenne powder in 4 ounces of warm water. 
Soak a cotton swab in the solution and stir it around to make sure it’s covered-the powder can sometimes sink to the bottom.

Apply the moist swab gently to the inside of each nostril until you can feel the heat. 
It may be a bit unpleasant at first, but take the burning sensation as a sign that it’s working. 
When it subsides, your headache will hopefully be wiped out, or at the very least better than before.

2. Go nuts
Instead of popping a pill when you get a headache, toss back some almonds. 
For everyday tension-type headaches, almonds can be a natural remedy and a healthier alternative to other medicine. 
It acts as a pain reliever because it contains something called salicin, which is also an agent in popular over the counter killers. 
Try eating a handful or two of these wholesome nuts when you feel the ache start to set in.

Note: People who suffer from migraines may find that almonds are a trigger food
